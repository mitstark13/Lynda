00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:02,186
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:05,750
There's no point in dwelling on it.
As the Vulcans say,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,618
<i>"Kup-fun-tor</i>
<i>ha'kiv na'ish Du stau."</i>

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,088
Do you know what that means?
No.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,323
Are you telling the truth?

6
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,091
<i>Nersh.</i>

7
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,162
This is ridiculous-- being upset
about Amy all the time

8
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:21,363
isn't accomplishing anything.

9
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:23,265
If I want to resolve
this situation,

10
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:24,867
then I need to take action.

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,102
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to find her

12
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:28,204
and ask her to marry me.

13
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:29,872
And if she says yes,

14
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:32,541
we can put this behind us
and resume our relationship.

15
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:34,109
And if she says no...

16
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,546
well, then she
can just <i>ponfo miran.</i>

17
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,251
He didn't mean that.

18
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:08,711
I think it's so adorable you're
making Sheldon breakfast.

19
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:10,779
Well, he's having
a rough time.

20
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,181
Amy broke his heart,

21
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:15,284
the DVR cut off the last minute
of <i>Doctor Who...</i>

22
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,987
that crow followed him home.

23
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,458
Aren't you worried you're making
French toast on oatmeal day?

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,027
Ah, well, what's this?
A pot of oatmeal?

25
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:29,064
Or, thanks to you, what
I will now call "gloatmeal."

26
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:32,134
Oh, I don't want credit
for that.

27
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:34,937
Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter,

28
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,106
lovely to see you
this fine morning.

29
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:38,173
You're in a good mood.

30
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:39,441
Yeah, I am indeed.

31
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:40,910
I have decided,

32
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:42,945
instead of wallowing
in sadness about Amy,

33
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:46,215
it is time that I find myself
a new female companion.

34
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:47,416
Oh. Good for you.

35
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:48,918
What brought this on?

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,287
I realized something--
when Amy was in my life,

37
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,656
I was hyper-focused on my work
and ignored her.

38
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:54,823
And you don't want

39
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,892
to make the same mistake
with the next woman.

40
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,495
No, I need a <i>new</i> woman
in my life to ignore

41
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,797
so I can hyper-focus
on my work again.

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,066
Hey, I made
French toast sticks.

43
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:05,534
On oatmeal day?

44
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:07,970
Ah, I also made oatmeal.
Ooh,

45
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:10,973
that's a lot of carbohydrates
for a man on the prowl.

46
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:13,042
You know what?
You eat it; you're married--

47
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:15,411
it doesn't matter
what you look like.

48
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:20,516
Don't take advice from a man

59
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,833
Thank you for coming by,
gentlemen.

60
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,535
No problem.
So what's up?

61
00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:58,005
Well, it was the two of you who
found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.

62
00:02:58,007 --> 00:02:59,973
Now that I'm looking
for my next girlfriend,

63
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,544
it seemed only logical that I
employ your services once again.

64
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:06,346
Y-You sure you're up for that?
She did hurt you.

65
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:09,249
Oh, no, it's all right.
I think of my time with Amy

66
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,886
as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum:
sweet and enjoyable at first,

67
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:16,557
but ultimately
a flavorless lump of sadness.

68
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,359
You're not wrong
about Fruit Stripe.

69
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:22,729
I-I was always
a Hubba Bubba man. Mm.

70
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,866
Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?
You're crazy.

71
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:28,969
Hey, the jaw wants
what it wants.

72
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:30,671
Gentlemen!

73
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:32,573
Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.

74
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,174
But what are you
looking for?

75
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:35,542
All I'm looking for

76
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:38,145
is an educated, intelligent
woman who shares my interests

77
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:40,147
while retaining
her own unique point of view.

78
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:41,315
She should be kind,

79
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,449
patient,

80
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:43,817
and most important,

81
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,955
unable to imagine life
without me by 10:00 tonight.

82
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,957
Isn't that
a little unreasonable?

83
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,425
All right, fine,
she doesn't need

84
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:54,628
her own point of view.
Now, chop-chop.

85
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,631
Come on, Amy,
show us the dress.

86
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,032
Okay.

87
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:03,637
But I'm really stepping outside
of my comfort zone here.

88
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,878
Uh...

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,981
I don't think any of your
comfort zones are showing.

90
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,482
Yeah,

91
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,684
it's your third date-- maybe
you could go more sexy.

92
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:21,788
Well, some people think
the sexiest organ is the brain.

93
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,757
No one ever bought me drinks
at a bar

94
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,793
because my brain
just popped out of my shirt.

95
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,529
Do you have any heels
higher than this?

96
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,696
He's pretty tall.

97
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,064
Ooh.
Ooh, tall!

98
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,200
Finally some details
about this mystery man.

99
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:34,935
Yeah, come on,
tell us more.

100
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:37,404
Well, I told you his name
and that he's tall.

101
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:38,672
What more do you need?

102
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:39,940
Did you kiss him yet?

103
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,376
Just a little peck on the lips.

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,315
Well, we're your best friends--
give us one more detail

105
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,917
and we promise
we'll leave you alone.

106
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,718
Fine. Um...

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,554
he's British.

108
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:59,126
All right, that is a juicy one.

109
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:01,628
All right, where is
Tall British Dave taking you?

110
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,331
Tea and basketball?

111
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,567
To that new Italian place
on Walnut.

112
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,701
Oh, nice.

113
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:09,536
I'm gonna go look for other shoes.
Good luck.

114
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:11,972
I threw out all my tall ones
when I married Leonard.

115
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:15,509
Hey, you want

116
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,778
to swing by that place tonight
and get a look at this guy?

117
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,047
We don't even know what time
they're gonna be there.

118
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:21,381
I'll just call the restaurant,

119
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:23,150
pretend I'm Amy
and check the reservation.

120
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,619
Damn, you're sneaky.

121
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:27,888
Yeah, but I'm little,
so it's adorable.

122
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:33,760
I think the quickest way
to find you a new girlfriend

123
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:37,230
is just to get you on every
dating Web site out there.

124
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:38,565
Are you sure?

125
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,968
I've heard that on those
sites, often when you think

126
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,503
you're corresponding with someone,
it's actually a computer program

127
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:45,539
pretending to be
a real person.

128
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:49,076
And you're afraid
it'll do a better job than you?

129
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,244
Excuse me.

130
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:52,245
No one does a better job

131
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,081
pretending to be a person
than I do.

132
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:58,352
Siri comes close,
but I know more jokes.

133
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,854
If you don't want to
use dating Web sites,

134
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,189
what do you suggest?

135
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,691
Off the top of my head?
Uh, prospective women

136
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:07,160
weed themselves out
in a battle of wits

137
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,695
until only one champion remains,

138
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:11,665
she shows up at my door flush
with the thrill of victory,

139
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:15,736
and then sits quietly by my side
while I watch <i>Daredevil.</i>

140
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:19,039
You seriously think women
would fight for you?

141
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,176
People compete for jobs
and trophies-- why not me?

142
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,712
He's right-- he knows
a lot of jokes.

143
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:29,383
Yeah-- no, but it is
basic human nature.

144
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:33,186
If we present him as a prize,
maybe they would.

145
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,888
Well, he's smart,

146
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,657
he's a respected
scientist...

147
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,560
<i>And</i> I have
the soulful eyes of a cow.

148
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,698
I don't know
if I'd say you...

149
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Oh.

150
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:48,802
I have an idea.

151
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:51,571
What if we put a post
on Craigslist that says:

152
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:54,474
"World-class Caltech physicist
seeking girlfriend.

153
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:55,809
"If interested,

154
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:59,112
solve the following puzzles
for a chance to meet him."

155
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,814
Oh, we'll make the puzzles
extremely challenging

156
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,849
to eliminate
unworthy candidates.

157
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:05,218
Oh, we could set it up
like a scavenger hunt where

158
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,055
the last puzzle gives the winner
Sheldon's contact information.

159
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:10,490
Well, this is actually an
interesting social experiment.

160
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,359
I'm a little jealous of the
people who get to do it.

161
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,360
Me, too.

162
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,195
And we've seen the prize.

163
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,535
I don't understand why we're
leaving so early for the movie.

164
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:23,737
Oh, I forgot to tell you--
we're gonna meet up

165
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,865
with Bernadette to spy
on Amy and her date.

166
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:26,607
What?

167
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,175
I don't want to do that.

168
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,976
What, and you think I
want to see a documentary

169
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:31,945
about aluminum can
recycling?

170
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,346
This is the movie

171
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:36,283
Big Soda doesn't
want you to see.

172
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,753
No, it's the movie your wife
doesn't want you to see.

173
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,089
So you're actually okay

174
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:44,024
with invading
your friend's privacy?

175
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:46,359
You're not curious
who she's out with?

176
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:47,694
Not really.

177
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,897
But you're curious
about aluminum cans.

178
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,134
You're a weird
little guy.

179
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,873
That's it. The Sheldon Cooper
Girlfriend Challenge

180
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,342
is officially alive.

181
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:04,077
Congratulations.
This is exciting.

182
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,245
Right now,

183
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,447
somewhere, a woman
is dividing the atomic weight

184
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,983
of the best noble gas
by the number of colors

185
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:12,986
in the oldest national flag still in use...
W-- then using

186
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:15,388
that number as the average speed
to calculate the travel time

187
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,390
from Mordor to the Shire.
And...

188
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:19,693
taking her first step
towards a lifetime

189
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:23,463
of laughter,
love and, best of all, rules.

190
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:26,491
I-I hope we didn't make
the puzzles <i>too</i> hard.

191
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:29,804
Well... if she can solve them,
it'll prove she's intelligent,

192
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:31,605
tenacious and...
so socially awkward

193
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:34,274
she has nothing better to do
on a Saturday night.

194
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:38,945
Golly, she sounds
too good to be true.

195
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,283
This is fun.
I haven't dated much

196
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:45,018
since my divorce.

197
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,087
Well, I'm having
a good time, too.

198
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,223
If you don't mind me asking, why
did you and your wife split up?

199
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,826
Oh, you know how it is--
we wanted different things.

200
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:54,094
I wanted children,

201
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:57,397
and she wanted a pastry chef
named Jean-Philippe.

202
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

203
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,635
No, it's-it's fine.
It's why I left England.

204
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:03,370
It reminded me
too much of her.

205
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:08,208
Cold, gloomy and easily accessed
by a Frenchman through a tunnel.

206
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,978
Hey. So, where are they?

207
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,114
Across the street,
in the left window.

208
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:15,782
Oh, damn it,

209
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:17,350
we should have brought
binoculars.

210
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:19,786
Right here.

211
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:22,322
We just happen to have those
in the car?

212
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:23,857
Kinda. Before I met Howie,

213
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,326
I liked to keep close tabs
on my boyfriends.

214
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,794
By stalking them?

215
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,896
No. Stalkers
are creepy.

216
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:31,798
I'm just a harmless little girl

217
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,534
with military-grade
spy equipment.

218
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:36,837
Oh, there he is.

219
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,171
He's cute, right?

220
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,540
Yeah!
Can I see?

221
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:43,491
What, now you're interested?
You didn't even want to come.

222
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:47,348
I know, but you guys make being
a crappy friend look fun.

223
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:49,449
Fine.

224
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,685
Yeah, okay, I see him.

225
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:53,286
It looks like
they're having a nice time.

226
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,588
I wish I could hear
what they're saying.

227
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,856
Yeah, I should've brought

228
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,023
my parabolic microphone.

229
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,092
Your what?
Nothing. Not important.

230
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:01,962
So you've never
been married?

231
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:05,098
No. I mean,
to be completely honest, I've...

232
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,467
I've only been
in one long-term relationship.

233
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:08,802
Oh. What happened with that?

234
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:10,370
That's a good question.

235
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,557
After five years,

236
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,293
it was just feeling like
more work than it should be.

237
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:20,427
Oh, that's too bad.

238
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,029
Was he a neurobiologist
like you?

239
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,365
No. He's a theoretical physicist

240
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:27,301
at Caltech.

241
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:30,237
I love teaching math, but
that would be my dream job.

242
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,505
What's his focus?

243
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,842
Um... used to be string theory,
now it's dark matter.

244
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,910
But... let's
not discuss Sheldon.

245
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:38,812
Let's get back to you.

246
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:42,282
Wait, you're not talking
about Dr. Sheldon <i>Cooper?</i>

247
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,887
I'm trying not to.

248
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:48,789
Do you know him?

249
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,225
No, but I've followed
his work for years.

250
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,393
He's a rock star.

251
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:54,194
You've got to
tell me about him.

252
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,996
What's he like?

253
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,135
He really seems into her.

254
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,405
I took a video.

255
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:07,274
I forgot how much
fun this is.

256
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,575
Okay, we saw them.

257
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,277
Can we go catch the movie?

258
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,346
Why'd you bring him?

259
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,948
I had to; we're married now.

260
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,017
Ugh, I hear that.

261
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,123
I'm sorry, just one more
question about Sheldon.

262
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,225
Sure, why not?

263
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,828
It's more of a four-part
question, really.

264
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:36,798
When he wrote his paper on
supersingular prime numbers,

265
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,367
how long did it take?

266
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,169
Um... about an hour and half.

267
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,504
Wow!

268
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,607
I mean, wow!

269
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,609
And you were
there to see it?

270
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,812
Yes. Yep. We were on a date.

271
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,083
Very much like this one.
Mm.

272
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:56,818
I doubt it was
like this one.

273
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,554
I mean, he's a genius, and
I wasn't even smart enough

274
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:03,125
to figure out why my wife
always smelled of croissants.

275
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,761
What was the rest
of your question?

276
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:06,938
Do you think you could
introduce me to him?

277
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:08,331
Really?

278
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:11,133
You-you want me to introduce you
to my ex-boyfriend?

279
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,068
You're right,
it's-it's weird.

280
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,003
No, wait. Do it.

281
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:17,906
No. I changed my mind.

282
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,708
I'd be too nervous.

283
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,277
Oh! I don't know
<i>what</i> to do.

284
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,613
Are we gonna be much longer?

285
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:26,648
I really have
to go to the bathroom.

286
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,850
Right here.

287
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:35,590
37 minutes left
until the deadline.

288
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:37,793
Someone will show.

289
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:41,163
And no matter what happens,
this is still a fun experiment.

290
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:44,733
Not as fun as the night we
blew up grapes in the microwave.

291
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:48,036
We really have led full lives.

292
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,172
Someone will show.

293
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,640
Maybe you don't want

294
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:52,808
someone exactly like you.

295
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,709
You know what they say:
opposites attract.

296
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:56,645
Well, by that logic,

297
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:00,115
I should be with someone short,
dull and needy, eh?

298
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:01,516
Not to cast aspersions,

299
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:05,821
but I can't shake a stick around
here without hitting <i>that.</i>

300
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,294
You know, I once
drove 500 miles

301
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,263
to hear him speak
at Stanford.

302
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:18,266
I have a DVD of that lecture.

303
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:20,268
Really? Wasn't it great?

304
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,905
Not as a Valentine's
present, no.

305
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,640
Well, the next time
you watch it,

306
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:27,409
I'm the bloke who
asked the question

307
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:30,412
that he said was
stupid and obvious.

308
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:33,715
It was the nicest thing
he said to anyone there.

309
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,550
That's, um, terrific.

310
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,420
Listen, I'm-I'm kind of tired.
Can we call it a night?

311
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:40,822
Oh, gosh. Sorry,
I've just spent the whole night

312
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,791
talking about your ex-boyfriend.

313
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,192
I'm such an idiot.

314
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,128
No, you're not.

315
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,064
Well, maybe not an idiot,
but certainly not as smart as...

316
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,832
someone we won't mention.

317
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,834
Thank you.
But you said

318
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,070
you might introduce me to him--
I'm free on Thursday.

319
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,206
Hey, hey,
they're leaving.

320
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,042
What? Here,
give me, give me.

321
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
they're coming right towards us.

322
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,715
We got to get out of here.
Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?

323
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:09,751
He and his tiny bladder
can take the bus!

324
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,157
Oh, no!

325
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,930
She just hit my car!

326
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:23,999
What are you guys
doing here?

327
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:27,969
Oh! Hey, Ames!
What are you doing here?

328
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:30,205
What happened?

329
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,274
OMG!

330
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:34,209
Aren't you
Leonard Hofstadter?

331
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,710
Yeah.

332
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:38,446
I saw you speak at Stanford
with Sheldon Cooper!

333
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,116
Amy, can you believe it?
It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!

334
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,287
No. Pinch me.

335
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,023
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
Can I shake your hand?

336
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,025
I don't know if you want
to do that-- I was just...

337
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,593
Okay, never mind.

338
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,496
Amy, I'm never washing
this hand again.

339
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:57,165
You really should.

340
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:01,002
60 seconds.

341
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:02,270
This is not looking good.

342
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,239
One minute is
a long time.

343
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:07,275
I've been telling women that
for 20 years.

344
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:12,681
45.
45 seconds is

345
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:15,016
plenty of time for a woman
to walk through that door

346
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:16,384
and fall in love with me.

347
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:19,487
You know, probably half that
if I break out the old cow eyes.

348
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:21,790
30 seconds.

349
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,258
Uh-oh.

350
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,860
What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?

351
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:27,128
What?

352
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,431
Oh, that last <i>Hunger Games</i>
was not my cup of tea.

353
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,334
You thought she was great
in <i>X-Men.</i>

354
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,768
Oh, fine-- I won't shut my heart

355
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,370
to the love
of Jennifer Lawrence.

356
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:39,653
Guys, 15 seconds.
Maybe she's waiting to show up

357
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:41,444
at the last possible moment.

358
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:42,811
Sounds like a drama queen.

359
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:46,681
Oh, no.
It <i>is</i> Jennifer Lawrence.

360
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,216
Five...

361
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,584
four...

362
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,186
three...

363
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:53,021
two...

364
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,422
one.

365
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,729
That's too bad.

366
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,231
Maybe we did make the test
too difficult.

367
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,033
I don't think it matters.
Look, Sheldon,

368
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,969
I believe when the time is right
for you to meet someone,

369
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,304
it'll just happen.

370
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:11,973
Okay? Not because of
a test or a Web site,

371
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:14,175
but because...

372
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:17,412
We are the dreamers of dreams!

373
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:25,720
It's an actual girl,
and she's really pretty.

374
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:27,555
Answer it!

375
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,024
All right.

376
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:36,564
Can I help you?

377
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:39,834
Um, a-are you the physicist that
placed the ad on Craigslist?

378
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:40,969
Yes.

379
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:43,071
Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett.

380
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:44,939
Sorry it took a while
for me to get here.

381
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,441
I was stuck in this
boring symposium

382
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,044
on atomic spectroscopy
when I came across your ad,

383
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:50,545
and it saved my night.

384
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,347
The puzzles were...
were really fun.

385
00:16:52,349 --> 00:16:54,449
I've never had
to translate Klingon

386
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:57,652
into ancient Sanskrit before.

387
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:59,354
Well...

388
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:02,557
careful, hmm, it's addictive.

389
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,561
Chija''e'vlKub je.

390
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:10,965
Or, as they say
in Sanskrit...

391
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,836
Ahm asman matey-bee
<i>ta-teyva.</i>

392
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:18,807
And just like that, you're
a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.

393
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,776
Anyway, I-I just... I knew
I had to meet the person

394
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:23,945
responsible for such
a brilliant idea.

395
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:26,481
And I don't need to tell you,
there aren't a lot of men

396
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:30,285
who love physics, archaic languages
and flags of the world.

397
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,954
I am a bit of a unicorn.

398
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:34,923
Well, you certainly seem

399
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:37,459
like a special lady,
uh, but as you know,

400
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:40,128
you missed the deadline,
so thanks for playing.

401
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,604
How could you
send her away?!

402
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:51,773
She was late.

403
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:52,807
And...

404
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,976
she found
atomic spectroscopy boring.

405
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:58,680
Well, I wouldn't coitus her
with <i>your</i> genitals.

406
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:09,956
Uh, thanks
for driving me home.

407
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,424
No problem.

408
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:13,026
I'm really sorry about your car.

409
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,327
Oh, it's all right.

410
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,063
If you're free next weekend,
I'd love to take you out again.

411
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,999
Um... listen,
you're a really nice guy,

412
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:23,269
but I just... I don't think
this is working out.

413
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,438
Oh. Okay.

414
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,572
I'm...

415
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,074
I'm really sorry.

416
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,243
No, it's...
at least the same woman

417
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:33,613
that rejected Sheldon Cooper
rejected me.

418
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,618
There you go.

419
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,354
If I ever do meet him,
we'll have that in common.

420
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:42,689
Sure. Heh.

421
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:44,657
And... he's kissed you
and I've kissed you,

422
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,997
so if you think about it...
Okay, get out.

423
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:56,106
